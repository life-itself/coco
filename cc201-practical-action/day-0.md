# Day 0: Welcome to the course

‚ÄúThe need for community has never been greater. Our hyper individualist dominated society is showing clear signs of decay - loneliness, mental health issues, and addiction are all on the rise. In the bigger picture, climate change, resource scarcity and global pandemics are a duality of symptom and causation of individual and collective struggles. It does not need to be this way. Conscious coliving is an antidote.‚Äù

Dear conscious human,

Welcome to our next mini-course, Conscious Coliving in Action! We‚Äôre thrilled to have you join us on this transformative journey. Over the next 8 lessons, we'll explore the practical aspects of conscious coliving and equip you with tools to bring it to life in a way that works for you.  
  
We started this series of courses with our Conscious Coliving 101 \[link\] which covers the fundamentals of conscious coliving, and Transforming Conflict in Community \[link\], which addresses how to use conflict for growth and transformation. This course dives deeper into how you actually engage in conscious coliving, with practical steps to guide you on your way.

We are covering a lot during this course and by the end of it you should:

- Be clear on what kind of conscious coliving environment is best for you

- What your requirements and expectations are for conscious coliving and how to manage these

- Be confident that you can find or create a conscious coliving space that aligns with you

- Have an idea of the next steps you need to take on your journey

## Quick recap: What is conscious coliving?

In a nutshell, conscious coliving is the act of living together with 2 or more other people with the intention of living more conscious and physically manifested lives together, in an environment with some level of shared resources.

Yes, it‚Äôs a little vague right now, but we‚Äôll be expanding on the full spectrum of conscious coliving in our first lesson tomorrow.

### So, if you are onboard with us, let‚Äôs expand on what the next 8 days will involve! 

Day 1: The Full Spectrum of Conscious Coliving - In this lesson we‚Äôll break down the entire spectrum of conscious coliving and help you reflect on which option works for you.

Day 2: Know your Values, Needs & Desires - Absolutely vital to conscious coliving and life in general, this lesson will set the foundation for you to create the vision for your coliving experience.

Day 3: Preparing yourself for conscious coliving - Conscious coliving starts with conscious living. In this lesson, we explore how you can prepare yourself for conscious coliving, before you even join a coliving space.

Day 4: Roadmap for joining a conscious coliving space - By far the most accessible way to engage in conscious coliving is to join an already established space. In this lesson, we‚Äôll take you through the steps of joining a space, from research to implementation!

Day 5: Transforming your coliving space to become more conscious - If you are in a coliving situation already and want to make it more conscious, this lesson is for you! We‚Äôll cover some concrete steps towards making the shift and how to enroll your coliving members.

Day 6: Considerations for starting a conscious coliving place - As we near the end of the course, we lay the foundation for starting your own conscious coliving space from scratch. In this lesson, we share what you‚Äôll want to consider before purchasing a space and getting started.

Day 7: Creating your conscious coliving space - In this lesson, we take a look at the necessary steps to creating a conscious coliving space and how to enroll new members once you‚Äôve got started.

Day 8: Closing thoughts and next actions - In this final email, we will wrap up everything we have learned during the course and how to put everything into action.

## Warning: Action Required 

While this course is filled with insight and information, the real work comes from implementing what you have learned in the course. Without the action there is little use for the attainment of information.  
  
We recognise that you might need time to make such a radical shift in lifestyle and so to help you integrate the information in this course, we‚Äôve added simple action steps throughout, which you can take right away. Look out for the ‚úçÔ∏è emoji - this is your chance to act!

## On that note ‚úçÔ∏è‚úçÔ∏è‚úçÔ∏è

Yes! Before we start there are a few actions to take right away:

1.  If you haven‚Äôt already joined, get yourself into our Conscious Coliving Whatsapp Chat! It‚Äôs a simple chat channel to connect with other people embarking on conscious coliving and share insights, opportunities and inspiration. Join here: [<u>https://chat.whatsapp.com/DycZceubrTzI1DHKHZr5sw</u>](https://chat.whatsapp.com/DycZceubrTzI1DHKHZr5sw)

2.  Make sure you save our email address in your contacts to avoid us unconsciously being routed to your spam. (Can you imagine?! ü§Ø)

That‚Äôs it for now. Congratulations on committing to taking steps towards a more nourishing and connected life.

See you tomorrow for our first lesson!
