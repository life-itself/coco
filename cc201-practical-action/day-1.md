# Day 1: The Full Spectrum of Conscious Coliving

Dear conscious human,

Ask the average person what conscious coliving is and you‚Äôll probably get answers along the lines of ‚Äúa bunch of communist hippies living in a cult and sharing toothbrushes‚Äù, to which we would say *exactly* . . . oh no, hold on . . . üëÄ

Conscious coliving is a relatively novel term and we‚Äôre doing our bit to make it more mainstream and bust myths like the above. There is a way to go, but we‚Äôll make it!

It‚Äôs a common misconception that conscious coliving is about sharing everything and that you have to be a hippy (we cover all the myths in CC101), but this is far from the truth. Let‚Äôs share some concrete examples of what conscious coliving might actually look like:

1.  A Cenobium of monks living in a remote mountain monastery in Thailand

2.  4 colleagues working different 9-5 jobs and sharing a flat in London

3.  2 families on a plot of land in Sweden with tiny homes on it

4.  A small village in Northern Italy

5.  An ecovillage such as Findhorn in Scotland

## A spectrum of conscious coliving

It‚Äôs not like you are consciously coliving or you are not. Most people who live together will most likely be experiencing some level of conscious coliving. It‚Äôs a spectrum, you see!

**Conscious coliving is not a particular type of environment; is it that a level of consciousness is present within it.** We‚Äôve tried to sum it up in a simple quadrant diagram with an x-axis from urban to rural and a y-axis from individual to communal. While the most individualistic end of the spectrum is likely to experience less conscious coliving, some is still present.

For example, a block of flats where couples or individuals live might pool resources for maintenance and have regular meetings and gatherings together to foster a greater sense of community. If this is done with a sense of awareness and embodiment (two key traits of consciousness), it can provide a conscious coliving environment for its members.

**The difference between conscious coliving and coliving is the relationship between the individuals and the collective initiatives they take to foster a more embodied environment.**

### Is the sky the limit?

Now you might be thinking that if all these examples are conscious coliving, what isn‚Äôt?! It brings us back to consciousness being the key determiner. By the end of this course, you‚Äôll have a strong idea and feel about what is conscious and what it is not.

## Is it better to consciously colive? 

We think so! If you are living with people it‚Äôs best to do it consciously. We cover the benefits in CC101, but here‚Äôs a quick list:

- More nourishing relationships

- Accountability for personal and collective development

- Greater mutual support

- Resource efficiency

- Economic sustainability

### Knowing your intentions is key to starting

As we mentioned at the start of yesterday‚Äôs email, conscious coliving is one positive factor towards navigating the complexities of the metacrisis we find ourselves in. You need to understand your reasons for wanting to consciously colive and realize that it won‚Äôt necessarily solve your problems around loneliness or mental health issues if you haven‚Äôt done the work to investigate this yourself (for example). But when approached from a place of 'I want to be an active part of a conscious coliving environment for the cause', then you are approaching it from a healthy place. Viewing it as a solution to your problems is like dating someone because you don‚Äôt want to be alone, not necessarily because you want to be with that particular person.

‚úçÔ∏è Get clear on your intentions for wanting to embark on this, and be honest with yourself, to avoid heartache, by writing **your top 3 reasons for wanting to consciously colive.**

And keep these handy as you go through this course!

## I hear you, I‚Äôm sold, how do I begin? 

We will be unveiling all the details soon, but the first step is deciding on the approach you want to take. You have three different options:

1.  Join an established conscious coliving space - Probably the easiest approach, especially if it‚Äôs your first time.

2.  Transition your current coliving space to be more conscious - This presents a myriad of challenges, but it‚Äôs possible and the collective journey will be a wholesome one!

3.  Start a conscious coliving space - Not recommended for those just starting out, but a really exciting option (we would love to see more conscious coliving spaces flourishing around the world)!

How you decide which approach you want to take will come down to a multitude of variables such as your economic stability, location dependence, property ownership, and more. Don‚Äôt let any of the variables put you off though - with the broad spectrum of options you can already start wherever you are at.

## Action Time ‚úçÔ∏è

In this email we‚Äôve covered the spectrum of conscious coliving and outlined the approaches you can take next. Now it‚Äôs time for some reflection so pull out your journal and answer the following questions.  
  
1. Where are you at right now? What is your coliving experience, are you new to conscious coliving or not?

2\. Which of the three approaches do you want to take for your next step? And why?

3\. Based on the two spectral lines from yesterday‚Äôs email, where do you see yourself on the conscious coliving spectrum currently?

In the next email, we are going to discuss values, needs and desires. This will help you decipher where on the quadrants you‚Äôd like to be and build upon the questions above, so make sure you‚Äôve completed them.

### A final action

If you haven‚Äôt introduced yourself in the [Whatsapp community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/DycZceubrTzI1DHKHZr5sw) yet, do it today. You can use the answers to the questions above as a framework.  
  
For example: ‚ÄúüëãHey I‚Äôm Kye, I‚Äôve joined the practical steps to conscious coliving course and wanted to introduce myself. I‚Äôm originally from Germany but currently residing in Australia. I‚Äôve had many experiences of conscious and unconscious coliving over the past 18 years and have developed a lot of skills for living in community. I‚Äôm still trialing conscious coliving, and have my reservations about what is right for me, but my next big step is to start a conscious coliving space locally. I am most interested in a remote village style conscious coliving environment, the kind where each family has their own house, but we develop a strongly aligned village of conscious colivers. Does anyone else have this vision too?‚Äù  
  
The next lesson is really going to help you ground your vision into reality and give you the tools to communicate your vision with others.  
  
See you there.
