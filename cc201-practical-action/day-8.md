# Day 8: Wrap Up - Are you ready to take action

Dear conscious human,

We’ve reached the final day of the course. Today we’re going to do a wrap up for you 🎁. Throughout the past 7 days, we've delved into three approaches to conscious communities and coliving - moving into a space, adapting a current one, or establishing your own. We've taken you through a process to understand the significance of knowing your values, as well as your needs and desires, and the roadmap for getting started for each.

Now that we've laid this groundwork, you might be wondering, **"What's the next step?"** The answer is simple and the whole point of this course: **take action** 💪. Begin by seeking out communities or spaces that align with your ethos and resonate with your vision of conscious coliving, enlist your current colivers into an opening conversation, or even start to research the feasibility of setting up your own space, but now it’s down to you.

It’s worth remembering that although community life can be more satisfying, it often isn’t as satisfying as we hoped it would be. **Living in a conscious community won’t solve all your problems, it might even create new ones, but it is likely to present you with ever expanding opportunities for growth and continued personal development.**

That said. . .

#### It’s easier than you think

Getting involved in conscious coliving is easier than you might think. You can start small by engaging with existing coliving communities, attending events, or simply joining online platforms dedicated to conscious living. This exposure can offer insights and connections and provide momentum to steer you towards your ideal coliving environment.

#### Commitment is key

We hope you’ve realized the role commitment plays in all of this. Once you've identified a community or space that aligns with your values, or have decided to transform your current space, **make a commitment**. This might involve becoming an active participant in communal activities, or contributing to the community's growth and sustainability, showing up at weekly events, enrolling in a trial period of coliving, or different ways of showing up collectively. Whatever it is, make a commitment, and get specific - what are you committing to, for how long, where, and with who? And don’t forget to understand your true intention behind it first so you always have something to come back to.

#### It’s fun

🎈 Engaging in conscious coliving isn’t just about shared spaces; it's about shared experiences and joyous moments. Embrace the fun elements - the communal meals, collaborative projects, the personal and transformational growth available and the chance to build lasting friendships with like-minded individuals.

#### You’ll learn a lot

Beyond the joy, conscious coliving offers a rich learning experience. You'll gain insights into diverse perspectives, expand your horizons through shared knowledge, and develop skills in communication, collaboration, and conflict resolution, to name just a few.

#### Go slow

Hopefully you’ve realized from this course that whatever option you choose, the key is to choose to go slowly. Taking time helps to really support alignment, so don’t let good old human impatience get the best of you.

#### The Bergerac Praxis Hub

## Action Time ✍️

It’s time to review your notes, your triggers, your next steps from the earlier days of this course and take stock of what has arisen for you over these past 8 days.

**For our final action time, we invite you to think forward to three months time, and ask yourself:**

1.  Where would I like to be at this point?

2.  Next, work backwards to understand what are the steps you need to start to take to arrive at this point in three months time?

3.  Join our Conscious Coliving Whatsapp Group

**Don’t overcomplicate things, keep it simple, but commit to taking action to see where it can truly take you on this adventure!** It’s easy to lose momentum so it’s important to have a plan to keep you going on the days where inspiration might be lacking.

And finally, before we sign off, remember, this journey is yours to craft. Take the leap, immerse yourself in the experience, and relish the transformative potential of conscious coliving. And don’t forget to keep in touch!

We wish you a fulfilling journey ahead!
